## Overview

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/), an AI research organization focused on creating friendly AI for humanity, offers the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) to access its powerful AI models for tasks like natural language processing and image generation.

The `ballarinax/openai.assistants` connector allows developers to seamlessly integrate OpenAI's advanced language models into their applications by interacting with [OpenAI REST API v1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants). This connector provides tools to build powerful [OpenAI Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) capable of performing a wide range of tasks, such as generating human-like text, managing conversations with persistent threads, and utilizing multiple tools in parallel. OpenAI has recently announced a variety of new features and improvements to the Assistants API, moving their Beta to a [new API version](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/whats-new), `OpenAI-Beta: assistants=v2`. The users can interact with both the API v1 and v2 by [passing the respective API version header with the request.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/migration/changing-beta-versions)


## Setup guide

To use the OpenAI Connector, you must have access to the OpenAI API through a [OpenAI Platform account](https://platform.openai.com) and a project under it. If you do not have a OpenAI Platform account, you can sign up for one [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

1. Open the [OpenAI Platform Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com).

2. Navigate to Dashboard -> API keys

## Quickstart

To use the `OpenAI Assistants` connector in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:
### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `openai.assistants` module.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/openai.assistants;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

Create a `assistants:ConnectionConfig` with the obtained access token and initialize the connector with it.

```ballerina
configurable string token = ?;

final assistants:Client openAIAssistant = check new ({
    auth: {
        token
    }
});
```

#### Setting HTTP Headers in Ballerina

Calls to the Assistants API require that you pass a beta HTTP header. In Ballerina, you can define the header as follows:

```ballerina
const record {string OpenAI\-Beta;} headers = {
    OpenAI\-Beta: "assistants=v2"
};
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operations

Now, utilize the available connector operations.


```ballerina
public function main() returns error? {

    // define the required tool
    assistants:AssistantToolsCode tool = {
        type: "code_interpreter"
    };

    // define the assistant request object
    assistants:CreateAssistantRequest request = {
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        name: "Math Tutor",
        description: "An Assistant for personal math tutoring",
        instructions: "You are a personal math tutor. Help the user with their math questions.",
        tools: [tool]
    };

    // call the `post assistants` resource to create an Assistant
    assistants:AssistantObject assistant = check openaiAssistant->/assistants.post(headers,request);
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

```bash
bal run
```

## Examples

The `OpenAI Assistants` connector provides practical examples illustrating usage in various scenarios. Explore these [examples](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-openai.assistants/tree/main/examples), covering the following use cases:

1. [Math tutor bot](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-openai.assistants/tree/main/examples/math-tutor-bot) - Create an assistant to solve mathematical problems with step-by-step solutions and interactive guidance.

2. [Weather assistant](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-openai.assistants/tree/main/examples/weather-assistant) - Develop an assistant to provide weather information by leveraging function calls for temperature and rain probability.


## Build from the source
